# Explainable Heterogeneous Federated Learning for Intrusion Detection in IIoT

This repository contains the code and experiments for my Master's thesis project:  
**"	Explainable Heterogeneous Federated Learning for Intrusion Detection in IIoT"**.  

The project investigates how **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques, such as **SHAP** and **LIME**, can be applied to interpret Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) trained in **Industrial IoT (IIoT)** environments across three paradigms:
- **Centralized learning**
- **Federated learning**
- **Decentralized (local client) learning**
